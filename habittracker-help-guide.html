                        After clicking <strong>Mark Complete</strong>, a confirmation message will appear. If you have already marked the habit as complete today, a message will appear advising <strong>‘Habit already marked complete today!’</strong>

                    How are the Weekly and Monthly Completion scores calculated?
                    <span class="accordion-icon"></span>
                </button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Weekly</strong> and <strong>Monthly Completion</strong> scores are calculated based on how many times you completed the habit this week/month compared to how many times the habit is expected to be completed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Completing a habit <strong>once per week</strong> for a <strong>Daily Habit</strong> will give a weekly score of <strong>14%</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Completing a habit <strong>once this week</strong> for a <strong>Weekly Habit</strong> will give a score of <strong>100%</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For <strong>Custom Habits</strong>, if a habit is expected to be completed on specific days (e.g., Tuesday and Thursday) and you complete the habit on Tuesday, the Weekly Score will be <strong>50%</strong>.
                    </p>

                </button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        The <strong>View Progress</strong> score shows your progress as it builds up over time, starting at 0% and increasing as you complete your habit. The <strong>Monthly Report</strong> reflects your overall consistency for the month, starting at 100% and decreasing only when you miss an expected completion date.

                    <p>
                        To set up Habit Reminders:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Navigate to the <strong>Settings</strong> screen by tapping the gear icon on the Home screen.</li>
                        <li>Tap on Reminders to open the <strong>Reminder</strong> Settings view.</li>
                        <li>Use the toggle switch next to each habit to enable/disable reminders.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong>With the Premium Version, you have the option of selecting the time for your Habit Reminder notification. </p>
                </div>

            <div class="accordion-item">

                    Why didn't my reminder for my habit come today?
                    <span class="accordion-icon"></span>
                </button>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>
                        There are a few reasons why the reminders for your habit may not appear:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For habits that are not daily habits, (such as Custom, Weekly or Monthly habits) the habit will only appear on the day that it is scheduled to be completed.
                            For example the reminder for a habit that is scheduled for every Tuesday, will only appear on Tuesdays.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The reminder for a habit will only appear if your habit has not already been completed for that day. For example, if the reminder is set for 10AM,
                            and you mark the habit as complete at 8am, then the reminder will not appear.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Note:</strong>You are able to toggle reminders for each habit in the Settings page, with the reminders designed to appear on the days that you expect to complete the habit based on your frequency. <br><br>
                        By default, these habits are scheduled for 10am at your local time. With Premium, you have the ability to customize the time the reminders are sent for each reminder. E.g, A reminder for 'Exercise' being set for 9am, while a reminder for 'Reading' can be set for 3pm.
