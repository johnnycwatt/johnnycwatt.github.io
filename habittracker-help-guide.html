        <h2>Creating and Managing Habits</h2>
        <h3>How can I mark a Habit as complete?</h3>
        <p>
            To mark a habit as complete, navigate to the <strong>View Habits</strong> screen, and click on the habit. A menu will appear giving you the option to <strong>‘Mark Complete’</strong>, <strong>‘View Progress’</strong>, <strong>‘Edit’</strong>, or <strong>‘Delete’</strong> the habit.
        </p>
        <p>
            After clicking <strong>Mark Complete</strong>, a confirmation message will appear. If you have already marked the habit as complete today, a message will appear advising <strong>‘Habit already marked complete today!’</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>How can I delete a Habit?</h3>
        <p>
            To delete a habit, navigate to the <strong>View Habits</strong> screen, tap on the habit you would like to delete, and select <strong>‘Delete’</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>I Completed my habit yesterday but forgot to mark it complete. Can I mark previous days as complete?</h3>
        <p>
            Absolutely! To do this:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the Progress screen for the habit you want to update (<strong>View Habits</strong> -> Click the Habit -> Click <strong>View Progress</strong>).</li>
            <li>Find the day you want to mark complete on the Completions Calendar.</li>
            <li>Click on the day you want to mark complete.</li>
            <li>A confirmation window will appear, asking if you'd like to mark that day as complete.</li>
            <li>After clicking yes, the day will be marked complete.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot mark a day before the habit's start date as complete.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Tracking Progress</h2>
        <h3>How are the Weekly and Monthly Completion scores calculated?</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>Weekly</strong> and <strong>Monthly Completion</strong> scores are calculated based on how many times you completed the habit this week/month compared to how many times the habit is expected to be completed.
        </p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Completing a habit <strong>once per week</strong> for a <strong>Daily Habit</strong> will give a weekly score of <strong>14%</strong>.</li>
            <li>Completing a habit <strong>once this week</strong> for a <strong>Weekly Habit</strong> will give a score of <strong>100%</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For <strong>Custom Habits</strong>, if a habit is expected to be completed on specific days (e.g., Tuesday and Thursday) and you complete the habit on Tuesday, the Weekly Score will be <strong>50%</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is the completion score in my Monthly Report and View Progress different?</h3>
        <p>
            The <strong>View Progress</strong> score shows your progress as it builds up over time, starting at 0% and increasing as you complete your habit. The <strong>Monthly Report</strong> reflects your overall consistency for the month, starting at 100% and decreasing only when you miss an expected completion date.
        </p>

        <h2>Setting Up Reminders</h2>
        <h3>How do I set reminders for my habits?</h3>
        <p>To set up Habit Reminders:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the <strong>Settings</strong> screen by tapping the gear icon on the Home screen.</li>
            <li>Tap on <strong>Reminders</strong> to open the Reminder Settings view.</li>
            <li>Use the toggle switch next to each habit to enable/disable reminders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Notifications are scheduled based on the habit's frequency, whether daily, weekly, or custom days.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Management</h2>
        <h3>How can I export my data as a CSV file?</h3>
        <p>
            To export your data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the <strong>Settings Page</strong> (gear icon on the Home Screen).</li>
            <li>Select <strong>Export to CSV</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If I uninstall the app, will I lose all of my data?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, uninstalling the app will delete your habit data. Make sure to export your data before uninstalling if you need to back it up.
