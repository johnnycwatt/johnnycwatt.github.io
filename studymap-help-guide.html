                    <p>Here is a quick guide on how to use StudyMap:</p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Add Subjects:</strong> When creating either a Task or a Class the app will prompt you to select a Subject. Subjects should be the name of the Subject/Course you are taking. For example Mathematics, Chinese 1A, or Physical Education.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Add Classes:</strong> You can add classes by clicking on the Purple and White ‘+’ button and selecting ‘Create Class’. Set up your school schedule by putting in your class times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Add Tasks:</strong> This can be assignments, projects, homework, exams, or just times you want to set for revision. This can be done by clicking on the Purple and White ‘+’ button and selecting ‘Create Task’. This can be one-off or repeated tasks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Begin using the app:</strong> The Home Screen will display the tasks and/or classes that are due today. The Calendar will show a daily or monthly view of all your tasks and classes. Finally, the Tasks page will show a list of all your Tasks and Classes. If needed, you can edit or delete tasks and classes from here.
                        </p>

                        <strong>Home Screen:</strong> You can mark any task that is due today as Complete simply by tapping on the task in the Home Screen. The Task will then show as Completed If you need to, tap it again to unmark it as complete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Task Screen:</strong> In the Task Screen, find and tap the task that you want to mark as complete.
