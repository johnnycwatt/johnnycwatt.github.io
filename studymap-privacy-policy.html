    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 12 January 2025</p>
    <p>Thank you for choosing StudyMap - Study Planner (“we,” “our,” or “us”). We are committed to protecting your personal data and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use StudyMap - Study Planner (the “App”). Please read it carefully.</p>
    <p>By using our App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>1. Scope of This Policy</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of StudyMap - Study Planner, including but not limited to registered users and guests. It covers the following aspects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data collection and usage, including personal data</li>
      <li>Storage of data locally and on our backend infrastructure</li>
      <li>User rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li>
      <li>Analytics and advertising practices</li>
      <li>Options for account deletion and data removal</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
    <h4>2.1 Registration and Authentication Data</h4>
    <p>When you choose to create an account, we collect the following personal information through Firestore Authentication:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email Address</li>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Password (encrypted and stored securely; we do not have direct access to your password)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used to create and manage your account, authenticate your login, and provide a personalized experience.</p>
    <p>All user-entered data (e.g., tasks, classes, subjects) is securely stored in Google Firestore. Firestore implements robust security measures, and access to user data is restricted by security rules. User data can only be accessed by the user who created it and is tied to their authenticated account.</p>

    <h4>2.2 Anonymous Account (Continue as Guest)</h4>
    <p>If you choose to continue as a guest, we create an anonymous account for you in Firestore. This allows limited functionality without requiring you to provide personal information such as an email address, name, or password.</p>

    <h4>2.3 Local Storage Data</h4>
    <p>We use AsyncStorage (on applicable platforms) for local data storage. This may include usage settings, preferences, and study data. This data is stored on your device and is only accessed by the App to provide a better user experience.</p>

    <h4>2.4 Usage & Analytics Data</h4>
    <p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about how you interact with the App, such as the features you use, the time spent on the App, crash reports, and other diagnostic data. This helps us improve and optimize the user experience.</p>

    <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> We store and process your data in Firestore to deliver the core functionality of the App, including personalized features and study plan management. All user-entered data (e.g., tasks, classes, and subjects) is securely stored in Google Firestore with access restricted by security rules.</li>
      <li><strong>To Improve User Experience:</strong> We analyze data from Google Analytics and local storage to understand user behavior and make performance improvements.</li>
      <li><strong>To Provide Customer Support:</strong> We use your data to respond to your inquiries, troubleshoot issues, and provide support.</li>
      <li><strong>To Show Advertisements:</strong> We use Google AdMob to display ads. Some usage data may be shared with ad providers to serve relevant ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Billing and Purchases:</strong> If you purchase the ad-free option, we will use Google Billing (on Android) or Apple Billing (on iOS). Your payment information is handled by these respective platforms, and we do not store or have direct access to your payment details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Hosting and Backend Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>All data related to user accounts, including personal information, anonymous account data, and user-entered data (e.g., tasks, classes, and subjects), is hosted on Firestore, a service provided by Google. Firestore offers strong security measures and compliance with industry standards. Access to user data is restricted by Firestore security rules and is limited to the user who created the data.</p>
    <p>Please note that while Firestore implements robust security, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. We strive to protect your data to the best of our ability and follow industry best practices.</p>

    <h3>5. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display advertisements within the App. Google AdMob may use user data, such as advertising identifiers, to display personalized ads. You can learn more about Google’s advertising policies and data usage by visiting <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy & Terms</a>.</p>

    <h3>6. Purchasing the Ad-Free Option</h3>
    <h4>6.1 Google Billing (Android)</h4>
    <p>Your payment information is handled through Google Play’s billing system. We do not receive or store any credit card data; all such information is managed by Google in accordance with its own privacy policies.</p>
    <h4>6.2 Apple Billing (iOS)</h4>
    <p>On iOS devices, in-app purchases are processed through Apple’s billing system. Your payment information is managed by Apple, and we do not have direct access to your payment details.</p>

    <h3>7. Your Rights Under GDPR</h3>
    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can request correction of any information you believe to be inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You have the right to request deletion of your personal data under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You may request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain circumstances.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to request the transfer of your data to another organization or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>8. Account Deletion</h3>
    <p>Users can delete their account and all associated data at any time via the Profile page in the App.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> All local data stored via AsyncStorage on your device will be deleted when you choose this option.</li>
      <li><strong>Remote Data:</strong> All data in Firestore tied to your account (including personal data and study-related information) will also be permanently removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once deleted, your data cannot be recovered. If you wish to continue using the App after deletion, you will need to create a new account or use the guest option.</p>

    <h3>9. Data Security</h3>
    <p>We take the security of your data seriously and have implemented reasonable measures to protect it against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, please note that no transmission of information over the internet or electronic storage method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h3>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy frequently to stay informed about how we protect your personal data. Your continued use of the App after any changes are made constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>
